		<h2>Scene graph</h2>
		A scene is a tree structure with a root and children. The tree consists of Object3D-instances. Each object has a transformation matrix.

		<h2>Geometries</h2>
		<p>A geometry holds all data necessary to describe a 3D model. Example: Box, Dodocaheron. The structure of an object</p>

		<h2>Materials</h2>
		<p>Materials describe the appearance of objects: Is it shiny, is it green, does it have a texture image.</p>

		<h2>Mesh</h2>
		<p>In ThreeJS a Mesh is an <code>Object3D</code> consisting of a <code>geometry</code> and a <code>material</code>.</p>

		<pre><code>
var mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );
</code></pre>
		
		<h2>Lights</h2>
		<p>In graphics programming lights are strange abstractions. In practice the <code>material</code> of an object determines what <code>fragment shader</code> program to use. The shader program colors the pixels on the screen by calculating the color using information about the material and the lights in the scene. So a light is more of an abstract description of a light source.</p>
		
		<p>Light calculations can be pretty complex but the simpler variants are called <i>Lambert</i> or <i>Phong</i></p>
		<p>Lambert shading is evaluated per vertex of the mesh. It is very fast but does not look very glossy.</p>
		<p>Phong shading looks smoother since it is calculated per pixel. It can look 'shiny'.</p>

		<h2>Camera</h2>
		<p>A camera in this context does not simulate a physical. It is simply a mathematical description of the eye position and view direction.</p>
